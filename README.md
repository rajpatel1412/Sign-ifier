# Sign-ifier
An Embedded Sign Language Detector on BeagleBone Green.
This application captures real-time video of signs in American Sign Language (ASL). It translates them into English to be displayed on a screen attached to the embedded device, converted to speech, or sent to a remote computer for processing and logging.  
We hope this portable application facilitates the learning of ASL for those who wish to learn and aids people with hearing difficulties to communicate more seamlessly.
